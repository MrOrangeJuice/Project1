        <p>Pong Ping is a top-down, physics based fighting game where players knock themselves into each other to cause
            damage or ring out the opponent.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Story</h2>
        <p>In the faraway kingdom of Puckland, pucks looking for fame and glory engage in the kingdom's favorite sport,
            that
            being Pong Ping. Players must use their circular bodies to push others out of the way in an extreme battle
            to
            the death, but with the tantalizing reward of the throne of Puckland itself.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 class="header">Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>The game uses an abstract style reminiscent of other physics based games such as <i>Human Fall Flat</i> and
            <i>Stick Fight: The Game</i>. Solid colors are used on everything where possible, with many objects
            represented
            by simple shapes. The one exception to this is the eyes on all of the pucks, which are deliberately made to
            look
            cartoony, in a similar use to <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>. As for sound, the game uses mostly realistic sound
            effects,
            since the abstract style doesn't lend itself to any style in particular, however the soundtrack would be a
            bit
            more intense and electronic, driving home the idea what this is a battle to the death in a strange society.
            For
            example, UI elements such as scoring would be punctuated by simple, satisfying dings, while navigating the
            ui
            would include sound effects similar to squashing and stretching rubber, which reflects the elasticity of the
            fighters. </p>

        <h2 class="header">Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>&#8594;Mechanics</h3>
        <p>Move: WASD, Move your character around the battlefield</p>
        <p>Parry: Spacebar, Time a button press to push back any opponents chargin toward you</p>
        <p>Charge: Click, An arrow follows your mouse's postion at all times; clicking and holding will cause your
            character
            to charge up a forward lunge, while releasing will cause them to release the charge and lunge forward.
            Colliding
            with another player will cause an elastic collision, hopfully sending them into a wall (causing damage) or
            into
            a pit for a ring out</p>
        <p>Fatigue: While falling into a pit is an instant kill, taking hits by slamming into walls will cause the
            player to
            fly back further when hit the next time, similar to the percentage mechanic in <i>Super Smash Bros.</i></p>
        <h3>&#8594;Tutorial</h3>
        <p>Upon booting the game, the player will be presented a simple tutorial with some immobile pucks for target
            practice so they can get used to the charging mechanic and the controls. The tutorial will also include AI
            pucks
            that attack the
            player, so they can practice the parry mechanic. The player will need to learn how to sucessfully attack and
            defend themself in order to succeed past the tutorial.</p>
