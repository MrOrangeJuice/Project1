## What is Pong Ping?
Pong Ping is a top-down, physics-based fighting game, where players must push other players off the stage or into walls
while protecting themself. The game is somewhat similar in concept to the Streetsmash mode from *Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS*,
which utilized a charging mechanic in order to push players around. This game features more in-depth mechanics, such as walls and
different characters. This is conveyed through an abstract art style, similar to games such as *Gang Beasts* and *Human: Fall Flat*,
which puts the focus on the intense and dynamic gameplay.

# Pong Ping Proposal

Pong Ping is a top-down, physics based fighting game where players knock themselves into each other to cause
damage or ring out the opponent.

* Genre: Fighting
* Platform: Web

## Story
In the faraway kingdom of Puckland, pucks looking for fame and glory engage in the kingdom's favorite sport, that
being Pong Ping. Players must use their circular bodies to push others out of the way in an extreme battle to the death,
but with the tantalizing reward of the throne of Puckland itself.</p>

## Aesthetics
The game uses an abstract style reminiscent of other physics based games such as *Human Fall Flat* and *Stick Fight: The Game*.
Solid colors are used on everything where possible, with many objects represented by simple shapes. The one exception to this is
the eyes on all of the pucks, which are deliberately made to look cartoony, in a similar use to *Banjo-Kazooie*. As for sound,
the game uses mostly realistic sound effects, since the abstract style doesn't lend itself to any style in particular, however
the soundtrack would be a bit more intense and electronic, driving home the idea what this is a battle to the death in a strange
society. For example, UI elements such as scoring would be punctuated by simple,W satifying dings, while navigating the ui would
include sound effects similar to squashing and stretching rubber, which reflects the elasticity of the fighters.

## Gameplay
### &#8594;Mechanics

Move: WASD, Move your character around the battlefield

Parry: Spacebar, Time a button press to push back any opponents chargin toward you

Charge: Click, An arrow follows your mouse's postion at all times; clicking and holding will cause your character
to charge up a forward lunge, while releasing will cause them to release the charge and lunge forward. Colliding
with another player will cause an elastic collision, hopfully sending them into a wall (causing damage) or into
a pit for a ring out

Fatigue: While falling into a pit is an instant kill, taking hits by slamming into walls will cause the player to
fly back further when hit the next time, similar to the percentage mechanic in *Super Smash Bros.*
### &#8594;Tutorial

Upon booting the game, the player will be presented a simple tutorial with some immobile pucks for target practice 
so they can get used to the charging mechanic and the controls. The tutorial will also include AI pucks that attack
the player, so they can practice the parry mechanic. The player will need to learn how to sucessfully attack and
defend themself in order to succeed past the tutorial.
